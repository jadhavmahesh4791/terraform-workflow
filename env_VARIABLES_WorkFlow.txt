TFLint:

TFLint is a static analysis linter specifically designed for Terraform. It checks for: 

** Possible errors: Such as illegal instance types or invalid resource configurations.

** Deprecated syntax: Flags the use of removed or outdated Terraform features.

** Unused declarations: Identifies variables, outputs, or resources that are defined but not used.

** Best practices and naming conventions: Enforces adherence to recommended coding standards.

** Provider-specific issues: TFLint can be extended with rulesets for specific cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure) to catch provider-specific configuration errors.

** Installation and Usage of TFLint:

###

TFLint can be installed via various methods depending on the operating system (e.g., Homebrew for macOS, Chocolatey for Windows, or a bash script for Linux). You can also use its Docker image. Once installed, navigate to your Terraform project directory and run: 'tflint'
