** Best practices and naming conventions: Enforces adherence to recommended coding standards.

** Provider-specific issues: TFLint can be extended with rulesets for specific cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure) to catch provider-specific configuration errors.

** Installation and Usage of TFLint:

TFLint can be installed via various methods depending on the operating system (e.g., Homebrew for macOS, Chocolatey for Windows, or a bash script for Linux). You can also use its Docker image. Once installed, navigate to your Terraform project directory and run: 'tflint'
